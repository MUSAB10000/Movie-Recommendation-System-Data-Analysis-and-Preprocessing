    "# Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Have you ever wondered how Netflix suggests movies to you based on the movies you have already watched? Or how does an e-commerce websites display options such as \"Frequently Bought Together\"? They may look relatively simple options but behind the scenes, a complex statistical algorithm executes in order to predict these recommendations. \n",
    "Such systems are called Recommender Systems, Recommendation Systems, or Recommendation Engines. A Recommender System is one of the most famous applications of Data science and Machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    " A Recommender System employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users' ratings for a particular entity, based on the similarity between the entities or similarity between the users that previously rated those entities. The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, many of the big tech companies out there use a Recommender System in one way or another. You can find them anywhere from Amazon (product recommendations) to YouTube (video recommendations) to Facebook (friend recommendations). The ability to recommend relevant products or services to users can be a huge boost for a company, which is why it's so common to find this technique employed in so many sites.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this kernel we'll be building a  Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. For beginners like me,this kernel will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's start.\n",
    "**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically three types of recommender systems:-\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **Demographic filtering (Simple Recommender)** -  The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **Content-Based Filtering** -  In content-based filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products. For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **Collaborative Filtering** -  The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that he will like the product Y as well.  This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.\n",

    "* **User based filtering** - These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity. This filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target. \n",

    "\n",

    "![User based filtering](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users. \n",

    "\n",
    "Although computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. One main issue is that users’ preference can change over time. It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply item-based CF.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Item based CF](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*LqFnWb-cm92HoMYBL840Ew.png)\n",
    "It successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. However, several problems remain for this method. First, the main issue is scalability. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. In addition, sparsity is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not be implementing Collaborative Filtering from scratch. Instead, I will use the Surprise library that used extremely powerful algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to minimise RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and give great recommendations."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I have built 3 different recommendation engines based on different ideas and algorithms. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Demographical Recommender: This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n",
    "2. Content Based Recommender: We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n",
    "3. Collaborative Filtering: We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n",
